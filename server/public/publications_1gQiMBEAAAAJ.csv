"Crop pest classification based on deep convolutional neural network and transfer learning","K Thenmozhi, U Srinivasulu Reddy","2019/9/1","Journal","164","N/A","104906","Elsevier","The growth of most important field crops such as rice, wheat, maize, soybean, and sugarcane are affected due to attack of various pests and the crop production is reduced due to different types of insects. The classification and identification of all types of crop insects correctly is a difficult task for the farmers due to the similar appearance in the earlier stage of crop growth. To address this issue, Convolutional neural network (CNN) with deep architectures is being applied as it performs automatic feature extraction and learns complex high-level features in image classification applications. This study proposed an efficient deep CNN model to classify insect species on three publicly available insect datasets. The National Bureau of Agricultural Insect Resources (NBAIR) dataset used as first insect dataset that consists of 40 classes of field crop insect images, while the second and third dataset (Xie1, Xie2) contains 24�…","Cited by 376"
"Insect classification and detection in field crops using modern machine learning techniques","Thenmozhi Kasinathan, Dakshayani Singaraju, Srinivasulu Reddy Uyyala","2021/9/1","Journal","8","3","446-457","Elsevier","The agriculture sector has an immense potential to improve the requirement of food and supplies healthy and nutritious food. Crop insect detection is a challenging task for farmers as a significant portion of the crops are damaged, and the quality is degraded due to the pest attack. Traditional insect identification has the drawback of requiring well-trained taxonomists to identify insects based on morphological features accurately. Experiments were conducted for classification on nine and 24 insect classes of Wang and Xie dataset using the shape features and applying machine learning techniques such as artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), naive bayes (NB) and convolutional neural network (CNN) model. This paper presents the insect pest detection algorithm that consists of foreground extraction and contour identification to detect the insects for Wang, Xie�…","Cited by 221"
"Machine learning techniques for stress prediction in working employees","U Srinivasulu Reddy, Aditya Vivek Thota, A Dharun","2018/12/13","Conference","N/A","N/A","1-4","IEEE","Stress disorders are a common issue among working IT professionals in the industry today. With changing lifestyle and work cultures, there is an increase in the risk of stress among the employees. Though many industries and corporates provide mental health related schemes and try to ease the workplace atmosphere, the issue is far from control. In this paper, we would like to apply machine learning techniques to analyze stress patterns in working adults and to narrow down the factors that strongly determine the stress levels. Towards this, data from the OSMI mental health survey 2017 responses of working professionals within the tech-industry was considered. Various Machine Learning techniques were applied to train our model after due data cleaning and preprocessing. The accuracy of the above models was obtained and studied comparatively. Boosting had the highest accuracy among the models�…","Cited by 131"
"Deep CNN: A Machine Learning Approach for Driver Drowsiness Detection Based on Eye State","Venkata KishoreKolli Venkata Chirra, Srinivasulu Reddy Uyyala","2019","Journal","33","6","461-466","International Information and Engineering Technology Association","Accepted: 28 November 2019 Driver drowsiness is one of the reasons for large number of road accidents these days. With the advancement in Computer Vision technologies, smart/intelligent cameras are developed to identify drowsiness in drivers, thereby alerting drivers which in turn reduce accidents when they are in fatigue. In this work, a new framework is proposed using deep learning to detect driver drowsiness based on Eye state while driving the vehicle. To detect the face and extract the eye region from the face images, Viola-Jones face detection algorithm is used in this work. Stacked deep convolution neural network is developed to extract features from dynamically identified key frames from camera sequences and used for learning phase. A SoftMax layer in CNN classifier is used to classify the driver as sleep or non-sleep. This system alerts driver with an alarm when the driver is in sleepy mood. The proposed work is evaluated on a collected dataset and shows better accuracy with 96.42% when compared with traditional CNN. The limitation of traditional CNN such as pose accuracy in regression is overcome with the proposed Staked Deep CNN.","Cited by 123"

"Parallel and incremental credit card fraud detection model to handle concept drift and data imbalance","Akila Somasundaram, Srinivasulu Reddy","2019/1/9","Journal","31","Suppl 1","3-14","Springer London","               Real-time fraud detection in credit card transactions is challenging due to the intrinsic properties of transaction data, namely data imbalance, noise, borderline entities and concept drift. The advent of mobile payment systems has further complicated the fraud detection process. This paper proposes a transaction window bagging (TWB) model, a parallel and incremental learning ensemble, as a solution to handle the issues in credit card transaction data. TWB model uses a parallelized bagging approach, incorporated with an incremental learning model, cost-sensitive base learner and a weighted voting-based combiner to effectively handle concept drift and data imbalance. Experiments were performed with Brazilian Bank data and University of California, San Diego (UCSD) data, and results were compared with state-of-the-art models. Comparisons on Brazilian Bank data indicates increased fraud detection�…","Cited by 75"
"Aspect based sentiment analysis of students opinion using machine learning techniques","M Sivakumar, U Srinivasulu Reddy","2017/11/23","Conference","N/A","N/A","726-731","IEEE","Recent times, customer wants to share good and bad opinions about their experience like usage of recently purchased product, services provided by a hospital, education and so on over social media, micro blogs, review sites and etc. Today smart phones become mandatory for most of the college students. They share their experience and feelings immediately over internet applications with others. Student opinions can be collected through the internet applications and can be categorized based on various entities. We propose a new method of analyzing online student feedback collected from twitter API by measuring semantic relatedness between aspect word and student opinion sentence. The results of this work will help the students to improve their studies and helps the instructors to improve their teaching skills. In this work classification and clustering techniques have been used to categorize the opinions.","Cited by 67"

Authentication and identification of device location are highly essential tasks to verify the originality of IoT Devices (IoTDs) during communication via open channel. In recent days, IoTD registration is processed through the Registration Center Authority (RAC) and this may face single point of failure and insider attack. To solve these problems, we propose a Blockchain based Internet of Things (IoT) Device to Device Authentication Protocol for Smart City Applications using 5G Technology (BIDAPSCA5G). In the proposed protocol, the IoT Devices registration process is performed through private blockchain.
