"Estimating fish weight growth in aquaponic farming through machine learning techniques","Purushottam Kumar, Pranav Tiwari, U Srinivasulu Reddy","2023/6/23","2023 3rd International Conference on Intelligent Technologies (CONIT)","1-7","IEEE","Due to the ever-growing population, rapid urbanization, unusual environmental change, and dwindling water supply, the food production from conventional farming techniques won’t be able to keep up with increasing food demand for long, leading to severe food scarcity. Aquaponics is emerging as a viable alternative to food cultivation techniques but lacks efficiency, hindering its adoption on a large-scale production basis. The adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques in smart aquaponic farming can further contribute to increasing the yield in aquaponics. In the study, both linear and non-linear regression algorithms such as linear regression, lasso regression, ridge regression, KNN regression, SVR, and decision tree regression were trained on aquaponic fish pond dataset, evaluated on the basis of multiple metrics like MAE, MSE, RMSE, and RMSLE, and a competitive analysis was done to determine the …"
"Soil Data Analytics using Machine Learning Techniques–A Survey","RV Raghavendra Rao, U Srinivasulu Reddy, Ch Ram Mohan Reddy","2023/6/23","2023 3rd International Conference on Intelligent Technologies (CONIT)","1-7","IEEE","Food security is the most basic need with any individual all over the globe. With food security we can reduce malnutrition in children, who are the backbone of nation’s development. To achieve this using machine learning techniques in agriculture domain is the new beginning. Machine learning techniques successfully implemented in innumerable domains, now entered in agriculture. Machine learning techniques establishes a novel way in data processing and data analytics, producing good results with larger data. In this work we carried out survey on machine learning technique’s role in agriculture domain and challenges involved in it. We examined the models developed based on agricultural soil. In addition, we analyzed the associations between soil nutrients, which help in crop yield. These results specify that the accuracy of the model is more with ensemble methods."
