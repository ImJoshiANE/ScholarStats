"Sparse Attention Regression Network Based Soil Fertility Prediction With Ummaso","RV Rao, U Srinivasulu Reddy","2024/4/16","arXiv preprint arXiv:2404.10274","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","The challenge of imbalanced soil nutrient datasets significantly hampers accurate predictions of soil fertility. To tackle this, a new method is suggested in this research, combining Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) with Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO). The main aim is to counter the impact of uneven data distribution and improve soil fertility models' predictive precision. The model introduced uses Sparse Attention Regression, effectively incorporating pertinent features from the imbalanced dataset. UMAP is utilized initially to reduce data complexity, unveiling hidden structures and important patterns. Following this, LASSO is applied to refine features and enhance the model's interpretability. The experimental outcomes highlight the effectiveness of the UMAP and LASSO hybrid approach. The proposed model achieves outstanding performance metrics, reaching a predictive accuracy of 98%, demonstrating its capability in accurate soil fertility predictions. Additionally, it showcases a Precision of 91.25%, indicating its adeptness in identifying fertile soil instances accurately. The Recall metric stands at 90.90%, emphasizing the model's ability to capture true positive cases effectively."
"Secured Frank Wolfe learning and Dirichlet Gaussian Vicinity based authentication for IoT edge computing","J Sangeethapriya, Michael Arock, U Srinivasulu Reddy","2024/4/4","Peer-to-Peer Networking and Applications","N/A","N/A","1-13","Springer US","With the evolution of the Internet of Things (IoT) several users take part in different applications via sensors. The foremost confront here remains in selecting the most confidential users or sensors in the edge computing system of the IoT. Here, both the end-users and the edge servers are likely to be malicious or compromised sensors. Several works have been contributed to identifying and isolating the malicious end-users or edge servers. Our work concentrates on the security aspects of edge servers of IoT. The Frank-Wolfe Optimal Service Requests (FWOSR) algorithm is utilized to evaluate the boundaries or limits of the logistic regression model, in which the convex problem under a linear approximation is solved for weight sparsity (ie several user requests competing for closest edge server) to avoid over-fitting in the supervised machine learning process.
